Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far for my project, I have been working on the start screen for the game, as well as creating the base grid for the game. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to create the actual game itself, utilzing user clicks/mouse clicks to play the game and implementing levels, feedback, and the exit of the game when the user gets a sequence wrong. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had some problems when downloading pygame, however, I was able to get pygame running after I run my program through the terminal rather than Idle. Additionally, I had problems with my start screen exiting quickly or not displaying the text I had desired. I fixed this by getting rid of the loop that had been displaying just a white screen while the program ran.
