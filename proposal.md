# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Working Memory Corsi Square Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that records working memory by testing individuals' ability to memorize sequence of squares on a grid


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For my project, I will make a working memory game task, similar to the Corsi Block Mapping task, which is a common test used to measure spatial and working memory. My software will show a set of instructions and a block of grids. For the game, the software will show a sequence of blocks that will light up and ask for the user to input the same sequence of blocks. The software will let the player know if they completed the sequence incorrectly or correctly. Then, the software will show another sequence of blocks (one block longer than the last sequence, increasing the difficulty). I intend to use pygame to complete this project. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be the basic set of instructions, the sequence of blocks increasing in difficulty as the player continues inputting the correct sequence, software letting the player know if they have gotten a sequence right or wrong, and the game ending when a player gets a sequence wrong. . 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of my project would be incorporating a results summary/data visualization at the end, as well as a quick neuroscience explanation of the task to the player. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of my project will include different conditions (such as telling the player to repeat the sequence forward or backward, based on the real task) or having a game option where difficulty levels vary based on performance (sequence length decreases if a player gets a sequence wrong instead of ending). 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project, I will need to download pygame and learn the pygame setup and fundamentals needed. Initially, I will need to create a start screen displaying instructions. Additionally, I will need to research how to get the user input of each block using mouse clicks and compare it with the correct sequence. I will also need to learn how to draw a grid and learn how to change the colors of the blocks to display the correct sequence for the player. I also need to research the timing control on pygame to control how long the blocks will stay lit when the game displays the sequence. These skills I need to acquire to create my baseline project. For the other components of a better outcome, I will need to use matplotlib to  include visualization of the player’s game. I will need to research an algorithm that will change difficulty if the player suggests (two incorrect answers in a row → sequence decreases one block, two correct answers in a row → sequence increases one block)
