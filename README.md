This project is a version of the Corsi Block Tapping task that is utilized in working memory research in neuroscience. As a neuroscience major interested in memory research, I thought this would be an interesting project to create. 

While the original Corsi Block Tapping task includes random placement of blocks, I couldn’t quite figure out how to do this without the blocks overlapping. Instead, I just used a basic grid of 9 blocks in 3x3 formation. Additionally, there were other aspects of my project I had hoped to do, but did not have enough time to try and achieve. 

However, my final project shows a sequence length of 2 initially, increasing by 1 each time a player achieves the correct sequence.
